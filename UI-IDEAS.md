# Ideas for the Android UI

Should probably use ViewModel

## FAB

Regular sized [+] floating action button to create a new task

## list of tasks

Use a list.
1 line items: name, number of days, button to set as done.

Each item selectable.
When you select an item, it brings up a bottom sheet with:

1. name
2. date it was done, button to bring up date picker and change date, button to clear date

## Accessibility

TODO!
