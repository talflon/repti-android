# repti

Simple Android app to keep track of things to do regularly.

For example, "exercise", "call Mom", "study math", "practice music",
"check to-do list".
The last day that a task was done is stored, and presented to the user
as "X days ago". The user can then update when tasks were last done.

## goals

### core goals

- remind and encourage to do the tasks
- remind and encourage to do tasks that have been left undone for longer
- avoid distracting or demotivating the user: see non-goals

### stretch goals

- group tasks into categories, to track both the coarse-grained
  outer category and the finer-grained specific task
- sync between devices
- encrypt user data
- undo/redo
- attach notes to tasks

### non-goals

- keep a permanent log: could distract a user into spending time on
  correcting the past log for accuracy. The less data is stored, the less
  data there is to input.
- push a particular task, or time to do a task, on the user: while this
  kind of thing might motivate some users, it could demotivate others.
  Users should use other apps for scheduling and to-do lists.
